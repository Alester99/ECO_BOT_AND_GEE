# ECO_BOT_AND_GEE

I got code from Space Research Institute of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine and the State Space Agency of Ukraine for collecting temperature data from map that can be created by machine learningin GEE. I adapted it for all Ukraine and made psibilities to download dotted data from all map to compare with Eco Bot. In the result I got few dots and most of them have big difference in temperature value.
